3. **Verify the block contents and hashes** in the Streamlit dropdown menu. Take a screenshot of the Streamlit application page, which should detail a blockchain that consists of multiple blocks. Include the screenshot in the `README.md` file for your GitHub repository.

4. **Test the blockchain validation process** by using the web interface. Take a screenshot of the Streamlit application page, which should indicate the validity of the blockchain. Include the screenshot in the `README.md` file for your homework repository.
